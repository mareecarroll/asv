<p>The ASV is a non-profit society for people interested in Astronomy, 
    attracting and catering for people from a wide range of ages and 
    backgrounds, abilities and interests. First formed in 1922 the 
    society has grown to over one thousand members. Its activities 
    are coordinated by a council of elected Office Bearers, Section 
    Directors, and ordinary Councillors.</p>

<p>The ASV has weekly activities at the ASV Lodge and a Monthly Meeting 
    at the Herbarium near the Melbourne Observatory. The society's library 
    is also located at the Melbourne Observatory and is open during Monthly 
    Meeting times. For over 50 years the ASV has played a major role in the 
    care of buildings and facilities at the Melbourne Observatory.</p>

<p>Our members conduct Astronomy for the People gatherings throughout the 
    year, bringing telescopes and astronomy to Melbourne's parks and schools. 
    Please check the calendar for details if you are interested in attending 
    one of these events.</p>

<p>>Our major project is currently the restoration of the Great Melbourne 
    Telescope.</p>

<p>Thanks to a generous donation from one of its most long standing and 
    respected members, the Leon Mow Dark Sky Site, located north of Melbourne, 
    has a pristine night sky for deep sky observing. The ASV has a 25-inch 
    telescope at the Leon Mow Dark Sky Site and a 20-inch telescope at the 
    ASV Lodge.</p>

<p>An annual Yearbook is supplied to members as well as a bimonthly 
    newsletter (CRUX) which all members are welcome to contribute to.</p>

<p>The ASV's logo shows the Southern Cross and Pointer stars. Its Motto 
    is "Sic itur ad astra" which is translated as "this way to the stars".</p>

<p>ASV is governed by a set of rules which should be read before applying 
    for membership. This document may downloaded by clicking here.</p>

<p>Any person or organisation with an interest in astronomy may apply for 
    membership of the Society.</p>
